# Ensemble-Models-ML
Welcome to the **Ensemble Models- ML** repository! This project is a comprehensive guide to implementing ensemble machine learning techniques with a focus on predicting heart disease using a real-world dataset. Ensemble Learning combines multiple models to improve predictive performance by reducing errors, bias, and variance. This tutorial demonstrates the use of Bagging through Random Forest Classifier to enhance stability, Boosting techniques like Gradient Boosting and XGBoost for iterative improvement, and model comparisons using performance metrics and visualizations such as feature importance plots, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. The repository includes code files for data preprocessing, implementing models, visualizations, and comparisons, alongside the heart disease dataset and an interactive Jupyter notebook. With step-by-step explanations, detailed visualizations, and robust results showcasing the advantages of ensemble methods, this tutorial serves as a practical resource for learning and applying machine learning techniques effectively. The project highlights Random Forest’s accuracy and feature interpretability, as well as Gradient Boosting and XGBoost’s superior precision and recall, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications.
